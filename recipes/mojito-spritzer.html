      Looking for an easy beverage recipe for your next beach day or holiday
      get-together? Enjoy the refreshing taste of a minty Mojito Spritzer!
    </p>
    <p>
      Start by making a simple syrup, combining sugar, water and a few sprigs of
      mint leaves in a small saucepan; cook on medium to low heat while
      continuously stirring as the fusion of flavors steeps. This will be the
      base of your cocktail, enhancing the bold cooling sensation and sweetness
      of your drink.
    </p>

      Once all the naturally delicious flavors have absorbed into a mint-infused
      syrup, remove the mint leaves, and let the mixture cool to room
      temperature. Then, pour your simple syrup into a cocktail shaker, adding
      the citrusy taste of lime juice, sweet Moscato wine and the herbal fresh
      scent of muddled mint. Shake vigorously until all ingredients blend to
      create a crisp, thirst-quenching refreshment.
