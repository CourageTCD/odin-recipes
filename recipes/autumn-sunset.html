      make a syrup. Simmer until all the sugar is dissolved, turn off the heat,
      and allow everything to cool. This simple syrup adds a nice touch of
      sweetness and zest to the drink.

      To finish, add 3 tablespoons of simple syrup to the glass of hard cider
      and pumpkin cider. Add Moscato and stir. Don’t forget to garnish the drink
