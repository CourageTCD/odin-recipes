    <h1>Directions:</h1>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Pour caramel onto a medium-sized plate. Pour crushed chips onto a
        separate medium-sized plate. Using four glasses, dip the rim of each
        glass into caramel, then into the chips. Refrigerate.
      </li>
      <li>
        Peel orange peel into strips. Lay strips on a cutting board, pith-side
        facing up. Using a sharp paring knife, remove the pith by running the
        paring knife between the peel and pith or scrape the peel to remove
        pith. Juice the orange and reserve the juice.
      </li>
      <li>
        Over medium-high heat, in a small saucepan, combine water, sugar, orange
        juice, a piece of the orange peel, and spices to make a simple syrup.
        Simmer until the sugar is dissolved. Allow to cool.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add 3 tablespoons of simple syrup to each glass followed by 3 ounces of
        hard cider and 3 ounces of pumpkin cider. Stir gently. Add a desired
        amount of ice cubes and top with Moscato. Garnish with orange peel and a
        cinnamon stick.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      <b>Tip:</b> The simple syrup can be made ahead of time and using this 2:1
      sugar to water ratio, can last for months.
