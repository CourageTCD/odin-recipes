    <h1>Pizza on the Grill</h1>
    <p>
      Pizza on the grill is a fantastic way to make pizza at home! The heat of a
      hot grill is a perfect match for a professional pizza oven. This grilled
      pizza recipe makes the dough from scratch and flavors it with garlic and
      basil. Use your favorite variety of toppings and shredded cheese, but it's
      best not to overload the pizza.
