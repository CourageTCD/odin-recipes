    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Discover the delightful combination of smooth bourbon, sweet apple juice
      and a hint of cinnamon in our bourbon apple beer. This unique beverage is
      perfect for those looking to enjoy a refreshing and flavorful drink on a
      sunny day or to unwind after a long week.
    </p>
    <p>
      To create the bourbon apple beer, start by whisking together 2 tablespoons
      of chilled bourbon and a teaspoon of honey for a natural touch of
      sweetness. Sprinkle in a quarter teaspoon of ground cinnamon to add a warm
      and comforting note. Finally, pour in 8 ounces of 100% apple juice,
      ensuring it's nicely chilled for a refreshing sip.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once the ingredients are combined, pour the apple juice mixture into two
      medium glasses. The beautiful amber color of the apple juice, complemented
      by the rich hues of bourbon and cinnamon, creates an inviting visual
      appeal.
    </p>
    <p>
      To complete the experience, top each glass with 6 ounces of Holland Lager
      1839, allowing the crisp and bubbly goodness of the beer to marry with the
      flavors of bourbon and apple juice. The fizziness of the lager adds a
      delightful liveliness to the drink, enhancing the overall drinking
      experience.
